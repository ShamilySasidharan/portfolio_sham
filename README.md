## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- [Next.js 14 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)


## ðŸŽ¨ Tailwind CSS v4 Notes
âœ… No tailwind.config.js
Tailwind v4 now doesnâ€™t use a config file by default. All styling is handled directly in globals.css.

## âœ… Global Styling (in app/globals.css)
If you are using third-party UI libraries like daisyUI, you can include:

@plugin "daisyui";
âœ… With ShadCN, no need to manually include anything â€” styles are auto-injected.
